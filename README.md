# 📦 **Ravdec - Lossless Data Compression**

## 🔹 **Overview**
Ravdec is a Python module implementing a **lossless data compression** algorithm designed by [Ravin Kumar](https://mr-ravin.github.io) on **September 19, 2016**. This algorithm is designed exclusively for **textual data**, including **alphabets, numbers, and symbols**. The algorithm offers two modes: 

- When `enforced_8char_input=True`, the length of input data must be exactly divisible by **8**, ensuring a **fixed compression ratio of 1.1429**.
- When `enforced_8char_input=False`, the compression ratio starts at **1.0435** for a **24-character input** (minimum required length) and increases with input size, approaching **1.1429** for larger inputs.

## 📊 **Compression Ratio**

### ✅ **When `enforced_8char_input=False`**
- Compression ratio starts at **1.0435** for a **24-character input** (minimum required length).
- Gradually increases, reaching **1.14** at **912-character length**, and further approaches **1.1429** as input size increases.
- Ideal for handling variable-length text data while still achieving efficient compression.

### 🚀 **When `enforced_8char_input=True`**
- Original data length must be exactly divisible by **8**, ensuring a **fixed compression ratio of 1.1429**.
- Much faster, making it suitable for **high-speed data compression**.
- Best for **real-time systems** where data is continuously growing and **frequency-based algorithms are time-consuming**.

## ⏳ **Complexity Analysis**

### **1️⃣ `enforced_8char_input = True`**
✅ **Time Complexity: O(n)**
✅ **Fixed Compression Ratio (1.1429)**
✅ **Ideal for continuously growing data**

- **Direct 7-bit conversion per character**
- **No padding calculations**
- **Optimized for speed**

### **2️⃣ `enforced_8char_input = False`**
📌 **Time Complexity: O(n) (with minor overhead)**
📌 **Compression ratio varies (~1.04 - 1.1429)**
📌 **Needs Padding Overhead**

- **Direct 7-bit conversion per character**
- **Padding calculation and storage overhead**
- **Slower compared to enforced mode**

### 📌 **Comparison Table**
| Mode | Time Complexity | Compression Ratio | Padding Overhead | Best Use Case |
|------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| `enforced_8char_input = True` | **O(n)** | **Fixed (1.1429)** | ❌ No Padding | **High-speed data streams** |
| `enforced_8char_input = False` | **O(n) (with minor overhead)** | **Variable (~1.04 - 1.1429)** | ✅ Needs Padding | **General text compression** |

## 🛠️ **Functions**

### 📌 `file_compression(filename, enforced_8char_input=False)`
Compresses a text file and saves the compressed data with the `.rdc` extension.

### 📌 `file_decompression(filename, enforced_8char_input=False)`
Decompresses a previously compressed `.rdc` file back to its original form.

### 📌 `compression(read_data, enforced_8char_input=False)`
Compresses a string using **7-bit storage**, returning a compressed string.

### 📌 `decompression(compressed_text, enforced_8char_input=False)`
Decompresses a compressed string back to its original form.

## 📥 **Installation**

Install using pip:

```sh
pip install ravdec
```

---
## 🔄 **Example Usage**

### ✍ **Compressing and Decompressing Text**
```python
import ravdec

data = "Ravdec !"  # Length of data is divisible by 8

# Compress a string with enforced_8char_input=True
compressed_data = ravdec.compression(data, enforced_8char_input=True) # compressed_data is '¥\x87¶L¸Ð!'

# Decompress the string
decompressed_data = ravdec.decompression(compressed_data, enforced_8char_input=True)
print(decompressed_data)  # Output: "Ravdec !"
```

### 🗂️ **Compressing and Decompressing Files**
```python
import ravdec

origianl_filename = "inputfile.txt"
compressed_filename = filename+".rdc"

# Compress a file
ravdec.file_compression(original_filename)

# Decompress the previously compressed file
ravdec.file_decompression(compressed_filename)
```
